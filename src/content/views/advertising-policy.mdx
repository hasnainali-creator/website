# Advertising Policy

This policy describes how OmnySports handles advertising and sponsored content. Our primary goal is to maintain the trust of our readers.

## 1. Editorial Independence
Advertisers and sponsors have no influence over our editorial content. All news reports and analytics are created independently of any commercial partnerships.

## 2. Clearly Labeled Content
Any content that is sponsored or paid for by an advertiser will be clearly labeled as "Sponsored Content" or "Advertisement" to ensure transparency for our readers.

## 3. Ad Content Standards
We reserve the right to refuse advertisements that are misleading, offensive, or incompatible with the professional standards of OmnySports.

## 4. Affiliate Links
OmnySports may participate in affiliate marketing programs, where we receive a commission on purchases made through our links. This does not affect the price you pay or the integrity of our recommendations.
